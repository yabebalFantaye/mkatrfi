AOFlagger 2.10.0 (2018-02-06) command line application
This program will execute an RFI strategy as can be created with the RFI gui
and executes it on one or several observations.

Author: André Offringa (offringa@gmail.com)

Modified single-baseline strategy so it will execute strategy on all baselines and write flags.
