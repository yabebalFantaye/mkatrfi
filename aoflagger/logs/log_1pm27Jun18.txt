AOFlagger 2.10.0 (2018-02-06) command line application
This program will execute an RFI strategy as can be created with the RFI gui
and executes it on one or several observations.

Author: André Offringa (offringa@gmail.com)

Modified single-baseline strategy so it will execute strategy on all baselines and write flags.

This program will execute an RFI strategy as can be created with the RFI gui
and executes it on one or several observations.

This program will execute an RFI strategy as can be created with the RFI gui
and executes it on one or several observations.

Author: André Offringa (offringa@gmail.com)

Modified single-baseline strategy so it will execute strategy on all baselines and write flags.

AOFlagger 2.10.0 (2018-02-06) command line application
This program will execute an RFI strategy as can be created with the RFI gui
and executes it on one or several observations.

Author: André Offringa (offringa@gmail.com)

Modified single-baseline strategy so it will execute strategy on all baselines and write flags.

AOFlagger 2.10.0 (2018-02-06) command line application
This program will execute an RFI strategy as can be created with the RFI gui
and executes it on one or several observations.

Author: André Offringa (offringa@gmail.com)

Modified single-baseline strategy so it will execute strategy on all baselines and write flags.

This program will execute an RFI strategy as can be created with the RFI gui
and executes it on one or several observations.

This program will execute an RFI strategy as can be created with the RFI gui
and executes it on one or several observations.

Author: André Offringa (offringa@gmail.com)

Modified single-baseline strategy so it will execute strategy on all baselines and write flags.

AOFlagger 2.10.0 (2018-02-06) command line application
This program will execute an RFI strategy as can be created with the RFI gui
and executes it on one or several observations.

Author: André Offringa (offringa@gmail.com)

Modified single-baseline strategy so it will execute strategy on all baselines and write flags.
